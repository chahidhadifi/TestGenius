## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: About

This project has been designed to facilitate the administration of exams for both students and teachers. The application includes a dedicated page for teachers, where they can add multiple-choice exams along with answer choices for each question. All exams created by teachers are securely stored and can only be accessed by the teacher and the application administrator.
